# MaximulProduct

This program will takes a positive integer, N, and returns the maximal product of a set of
positive integers whose sum is N. Invalid inputs should return 0, that is non-positive integers or
any integer where no set of at least 2 positive addends exists.
For example: Given 8, the result is 18
8 can be written as 2+2+2+2 whose product is 16. However, it can also be written as 3+3+2
whose product is 18.
